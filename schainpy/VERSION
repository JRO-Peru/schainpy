VERSIONS:

2.1.2:
-jroutils_ftp.py: Bug fixed, Any error sending file stopped the Server Thread
				  Server thread opens and closes remote server each time file list is sent
-jroplot_spectra.py: Noise path was not being created when noise data is saved.
-jroIO_base.py: startTime can be greater than endTime. Example: SpreadF [18:00 - 07:00]

2.1.3:
-jroplot_heispectra.py: SpectraHeisScope was not showing the right channels
-jroproc_voltage.py: Bug fixed selecting profiles (self.nProfiles took a wrong value),
					 Bug fixed selecting heights by block (selecting profiles instead heights)
-jroproc_voltage.py: New feature added: decoding data by block using FFT.
-jroIO_heispectra.py: Bug fixed in FitsReader. Using local Fits instance instead schainpy.mode.data.jrodata.Fits.
-jroIO_heispectra.py: Channel index list does not exist.

2.1.3.1:
-GUI: every icon were resized
-jroproc_voltage.py: Print a message when "Read from code" option is selected and the code is not defined inside data file

2.1.3.2:
-GUI: user interaction enhanced
-controller_api.py: Safe access to ControllerThead

2.1.3.3:
-Colored Button Icons were added to GUI

2.1.4:
-Sending error notifications to signal chain administrator
-Login to email server added

2.1.4.1:
-Send notifications when an error different to ValueError is detected

2.1.4.2:
-A new Plotter Class was added
-Project.start() does not accept filename as a parameter anymore

2.1.5:
-serializer module added to Signal Chain
-jroplotter.py added to Signal Chain

2.2.0:
-GUI: use of external plotter
-Compatible with matplotlib 1.5.0

2.2.1:
-Bugs fixed in GUI
-Views were improved in GUI
-Support to MST-ISR experiments
-Bug fixed getting noise using hyldebrant. (minimum number of points > 20%)
-handleError added to jroplotter.py

2.2.2:
-VoltageProc: ProfileSelector, Reshape, Decoder with nTxs!=1 and getblock=True was tested
-Rawdata and testRawdata.py added to Signal Chain project

2.2.3:
-Bug fixed in GUI: Error getting(reading) Code value
-Bug fixed in GUI: Flip option always needs channelList field
-Bug fixed in jrodata: when one branch modified a value in "dataOut" (example: dataOut.code) this value
was modified for every branch (because this was a reference). It was modified in data.copy()
-Bug fixed in jroproc_voltage.profileSelector(): rangeList replaces to profileRangeList.


2.2.3.1:
-Filtering block by time has been added.
